notes and things to do in the future
1. note the behavior of most form fields. 
when typing you are changing state. (onChange event listens to every keystroke)
after typing, you must set their value to the final state.

where as the buttons and forms normally call functions. 

FUTURE WORK.
1. allow multiple selection of fields
2. allow othe text area for typing the message to expand with teh text. then when
it reaches like 7 rows, it will scroll.
